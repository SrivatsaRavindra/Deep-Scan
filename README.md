## About The Project

DeepFakeDetector tackles the growing threat of AI-generated deepfakes by leveraging a custom dataset of real and synthetic images. Unlike generic models, this project:

-Uses Roop-generated deepfakes for realistic training data.
-Combines public figures (celebrities, politicians) with private consented images (not shared publicly).

### Built With

This project was built with the following technologies:

- TensorFlow
- CNN
- ResNet

## Dataset Information
This dataset exclusively focuses on **Indian faces** across multiple high-visibility domains!
### Dataset Creation Pipeline
1. **Real Images Collection**:
   - Downloaded images of prominent figures from Google of these:
     - Bollywood (Actors)
     - Business Leaders (Tech CEOs, Entrepreneurs)
     - Daily Soap Actors
     - Politicians (Indian)
     - Cricketers (Indian Players)
     - Musicians (Indian)
   - Private consented images (not shared publicly)
   - [Image Downloader Script](Download_Real_Images.py) (Google Images scraping)
   - [Face Cropping Script](Face_Crop.ipynb) (Haar Cascade/MediaPipe)

2. **Fake Images Generation**:
   - Created deepfakes using [Roop](https://github.com/s0md3v/roop)
   - [Face Swapping Script](Roop_Face_Swap(Fake_Images).py) (Roop implementation)

(### Dataset Statistics
| Category       | Count | Source Breakdown          |
|----------------|-------|---------------------------|
| Real Images    | 92,122| Bollywood (40%), Politicians (20%), Others (40%)|
| Fake Images    | 92,122| Uniformly distributed swaps across all categories|)

### Why This Dataset?
This dataset provides **three critical advantages** over existing benchmarks:

1. **Diversity in Ethnicity/Context**:
   - Covers Indian/Asian faces (often underrepresented in Western datasets)
   - Includes varied lighting conditions (studio shots vs. public appearances)

2. **Real-World Testing Ground**:
   - Politicians/Celebrities are common deepfake targets
   - Business leaders represent "high-stakes" verification scenarios

3. **Controlled Artifacts**:
   - Roop-generated fakes exhibit consistent manipulation patterns


## Prerequisites

1. This project requires python to be installed in your system. If you don&#39;t have it installed, you can follow these steps:

- Install python [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Run the installer and check the box for "Add Python to PATH" before clicking "Install Now."
- Verify the installation by opening Command Prompt (Win + R, type cmd, press Enter) and running:
  
  ```sh
  python --version
  ```

  If python has been installed correctly, your terminal should display the version of python installed on your machine.
2. Ensure all the nessasary packages are installed
  Use 'pip install' to install any packages required. For Example
  ```sh
  pip install tenserflow
  ```
  ```sh
  pip install OpenCV
  ```
  ```sh
  pip install tqmd
  ```
  
(((## Model Development 

- Pre-Processing.
- CNN architecture used (layers, activation functions,
optimizers, etc.)
- Training and validation strategy implemented (train-test
split, augmentation, etc.)
- Regularization and hyperparameter tuning considered for
generalization and robustness
-Proper choice of Loss Function etc.

)))


((### Installation

Please follow the following steps for successful installation:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Get started by cloning the repository to your local machine.

   ```
   https://github.com/ShaanCoding/makeread.me
   ```

2. **Install Frontend Packages:** Navigate to the &quot;/frontend&quot; directory and install the required yarn packages by executing the following command in your terminal:

   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Install Backend Packages:** Similarly, navigate to the &quot;/backend&quot; directory and install the required yarn packages by executing the following command in your terminal:

   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment:**

   - In the &quot;/backend&quot; directory, copy the content of &quot;.env.example&quot; file and create a new file named &quot;.env&quot;. Adjust the environment variables according to your requirements or you can leave them as it is.

   - Navigate to &quot;frontend/api/generated/readMeGenerator.ts&quot; and set the BASE parameter to your backend API route. For instance, if you are running backend on your local server at port 8080, you should set:

     ```javascript
     BASE: "http://localhost:8080/api";
     ```

5. **Run the Backend:** Navigate to &quot;/backend&quot; directory and type the following command in your terminal to run your backend server:

   ```sh
   yarn dev
   ```

6. **Run the Frontend:** Finally, navigate to &quot;/frontend&quot; directory and type the following command in your terminal to run your frontend server:

   ```sh
   yarn dev
   ```

   Now, your application should be successfully up and running!)))

## Roadmap

The roadmap includes both completed and future goals. Here&#39;s what we have accomplished and looking forward to:

- [x] Add backend swagger generation
- [x] Add backend
- [x] Set up CI/CD on railway
- [x] Allow dynamic input field generation based off a JSON file
  - [x] Textarea
  - [x] Input
  - [x] Objects
  - [x] Array
- [x] Allow users to set the order of components or delete them
- [x] Allow templating via Nunjucks
- [x] Add Plausible Analytics
- [x] Add old readme generator template
- [ ] Add more templates
- [ ] Move rendering logic to the backend with debounce
- [x] Replace useEffect with react query
- [ ] Add caching
- [ ] Write up README best practice articles
- [ ] Avoid key collisions when using non-unique-names as Ids in templates

We continue our commitment to improving and expanding the capabilities of makeread.me to provide an efficient and seamless readme generation experience to our users.
